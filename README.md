# What I Learned
Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights and experience in several key areas:

- CodeIgniter 4 Framework: I learned how to set up and configure a project using CodeIgniter 4, understanding its structure, and utilizing its features to streamline development.
- MVC Model: The project reinforced the principles of the MVC architecture, helping me appreciate the separation of concerns and how to implement it effectively in a web application.
- PHP: I expanded my knowledge of PHP, learning more about its advanced features, and how to use it effectively in conjunction with CodeIgniter.
- SQL: I enhanced my skills in MySQL, learning how to design, implement, and manage a database to support the application's requirements.

# Current Status
As of now, the project has been put on hold. While it provided significant learning opportunities and helped me achieve my initial goals, other priorities have required my attention. Consequently, active development has been paused.
